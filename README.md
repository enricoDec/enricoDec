### Hi there 👋
### I'm Enrico

I'm doing my master degree in applied computer science at the [HTW Berlin](https://www.htw-berlin.de/en/) and currently working as working-student at [PikeTec](https://piketec.com/). At the moment I mostly program in Java ☕️ and C. I do occasionally work on some open-source projects check them out [here](https://github.com/enricoDec?tab=repositories).
